I want to build wedding invitation website. I need you to carft an instruction to be used to develop this app. so its like to-do list and step by step to develop this app. i will give you the requirement, and you sent me an MD file as the result.

Tech Stack:

Frontend:

Next.js
Tailwindcss
Shadcn
React Awesome Reveal
Lucide React
Lenis

Backend:

For this I need your suggestion, what backend CMS + Database that can easily deploy to serverless like Vercel or Netlify.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build this website with references from attached image in folder references. i have given the match with the section

(e.g intro section = 1_intro, banner section = 2_banner)

For the content of the website check folder content, read the content.md. check content/images folder for the images used in the website, i also given the name match the needs (e.g banner.jpg, groom.jpg, gallery-1.jpn)

So the backend will be needed in 2 feature

1. RSVP

user can input name, number of guest, and confirmation will come

2. Blessing

user can input their name and blessing / comment, and then there is a list of the blessing.

!Note:

1. Intro will covering the whole website (fullscreen) and cannot be scrolled. when user click open invitation, intro disappear and show the whole website
2. there will be a song played, automatically played after click open invitation, and then there is a toggle sticky on the bottom right to play and pause the song
3. Use react awesome reveal for every content (e.g title, text) triggered once
4. website is mobile only, for the desktop view, create a mobile frame, example attached in references/mobile-frame-sample.png
5. website will be deployed in vercel, i want it both frontend and backend, make sure the capabilities
6. for the backend, create a simple CMS to display RSVP and Blessing Data.
